The Lonely But Tender Ghost likes it when you squeeze him gently but doesn't like it when you squeeze him too hard.  The light turns green and he makes a happy sound when you squeeze him just right. If you squeeze too hard the light turns red and he makes a distressed sound.   Otherwise, the light blinks white.  If a period of time passes, he will get lonely.  If he's lonely, the light will turn yellow and he'll make a lonely sound until you squeeze him again.
